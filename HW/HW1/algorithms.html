                <p>Algorithms are actually pretty fun. Really we have been using these throughout of our lives.</p>
                <p>An algorithm is just a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.</p>
                <p>The image below shows some examples of the most common types of algorithms in Computer Science.</p>
                <p>Notice, the table also contains a portion on time. It is using something special called Big O Notation. 
                There are wonderful articles and tutorials on O Notation I will get into another time. For now, go over the different algorithms.</p>

The bartender says, “I’ll have to charge you extra, that’s a root beer float”.<br />
So the guy says, “In that case, better make it a double.”</em><br />
